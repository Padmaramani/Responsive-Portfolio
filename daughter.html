                <p id="daughtertext">Hi! My daughter Diya loves to do art, DIY crafts and play with her best friend Aayra.
                    She likes to play games on my phone. She likes to do projects in scratch that I teach
                    her. She dances, plays the piano and learns Violin in her school. She is looking to get 
                    back to her swimming.
